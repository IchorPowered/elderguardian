[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/connorhartley/elderguardian.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/connorhartley/elderguardian) [![Sponge API](https://img.shields.io/badge/sponge--api-6.0.0-orange.svg)](https://github.com/SpongePowered/SpongeAPI)

Guardian is an extensible AntiCheat for Sponge that gives you the flexibility to customize the checks to fit your servers needs.
Guardian also provides a service for Precogs to reduce plugin conflicts with those who integrate with the lightweight service.

ElderGuardian is an optional mixin mod for Guardian that adds extra utilities otherwise inaccessible from the Sponge API.

**This is a work in progress and does not work currently.**
